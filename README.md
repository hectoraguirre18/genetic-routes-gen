- Carlos García

## Software requirements:
- Python
- Pip
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
```
pip install geneticalgorithm
```
```

```

# Opportunity areas
- Use an Map API instead of an image
- Use the geneticalalgorithm's new version 
- Increase the route number capacity
- Add input and output file compatibility (e.g. txt, csv, xlsx, etc.)
